        <h2>Storyboard, Character, Set, and Mechanical Design</h2>
        <p> The final day we worked on getting the drawings done so that we could insert them into the final animation, then submit it.</p>
        <h2>Technology and Code</h2>
        <p>We used Dragon Frame by using this program to store all the photos needed for the animation, then putting it altogether. We didn't include lighting because we decided it would look better without it </p>
        <h2>Social Impact, Audience, and 5 Whys</h2>
        <p>We worked with the characters and the sets so that we could emphasize the fact that pollution isnâ€™t sustainable for the environment. This animation is intended to inform audiences and maybe scare them about the negative impacts of pollution and pollutant's repercussions.</p>
